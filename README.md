## Known issues

- Referencing scoped CSS bundles isn't working properly yet.
  - Workaround: Reference the scope bundle directly
- Configuring a root component for a `BlazorWebView` from a different project has some issues.
  - Workaround: Wrap the root component in another component in the .NET MAUI project.
